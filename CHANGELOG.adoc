= Changelog

== Version 2.1.0

* Add new goal lint, which runs linting using helm lint.

== Version 2.0.0

* Support multiple platforms.
* Download official helm binary release if release is missing in remote artifact repository.
* Resolve helm binary as a regular Maven artifact. This allows to share the binary via the local Maven repository,
  so it doesn't have to be re-downloaded for every project.
* Add new goal `template`, which renders the template using `helm template`.
* Set helm chart version via `--version`. This allows to entirely omit the version in the `Chart.yaml`.
* Simplify goal names. Goals now can be run using short names (`mvn helm:package helm:deploy`).
* Do not create files in the temporary system folder any more.
* Introduced `helm.skip` property for skipping plugin execution.
* Packaging and deploying have been split, so you have to add `<goal>deploy</goal>` to the `<goals>` section of the
  plugin configuration. Also, the `<skipPublishing>` option has been removed, since the same result can be achieved by
  omitting the `deploy` goal from the `<goals>`.
